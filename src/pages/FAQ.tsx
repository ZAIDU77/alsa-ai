It can open applications, create files, take screenshots, record your screen, create complete coding projects, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, and even control your Android phone via ADB. It's not just conversation - it's execution."
  },
  {
    category: "General",
    question: "Is ALSA AI free to use?",

  // PC Bridge
  {
    category: "PC Bridge",
    question: "What is the PC Bridge and how does it work?",
    answer: "The PC Bridge is a Python script that runs locally on your computer. It creates a secure connection between ALSA AI and your PC, enabling AI-powered automation like opening apps, creating files, taking screenshots, and executing commands. You download the bridge file based on your subscription tier."
  },
  {
    category: "PC Bridge",
    question: "Is the PC Bridge secure?",
    answer: "Yes! The PC Bridge uses encrypted communication and token-based authentication. It only accepts commands from your authenticated ALSA AI session. The bridge runs locally on your machine and never shares your data with third parties."
  },
  {
    category: "PC Bridge",
    question: "What are the system requirements for PC Bridge?",
    answer: "You need Python 3.8 or higher installed on your computer. The bridge works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Required packages include Flask, PyAutoGUI, Pillow, and python-pptx, which can be installed via pip."
  },
  {
    category: "PC Bridge",
    question: "Why can't free tier users use PC Bridge?",
    answer: "PC control capabilities require significant resources and carry potential security implications. To ensure quality service and responsible usage, PC Bridge is exclusively available for Pro and Elite subscribers."
  },
  
  // Features
  {
    category: "Features",
    question: "What can ALSA AI do with voice commands?",
    answer: "With voice commands (Pro/Elite), you can speak naturally to control your PC: 'Open Chrome', 'Take a screenshot', 'Create a new folder on Desktop', 'Search YouTube for music videos', and much more. Press Alt+V to activate voice mode."
  },
  {
    category: "Features",
    question: "Can ALSA AI create complete coding projects?",
    answer: "Absolutely! ALSA AI can generate full-stack projects including React apps, Node.js backends, Python applications, and HTML/CSS websites. It creates proper folder structures, dependencies, configuration files, and production-ready code."

    answer: "Yes! Elite subscribers can use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) control. Connect your phone via USB or WiFi, enable USB debugging, and ALSA AI can send commands, install apps, capture screenshots, and automate your Android device."
  },
  
  // Subscription & Billing
  {
    category: "Billing",
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We accept all major payment methods through Razorpay including credit/debit cards, UPI, net banking, and wallets like Paytm, PhonePe, and Google Pay. All transactions are secure and encrypted."

  },
  {
    category: "Billing",
    question: "What's the difference between Pro and Elite plans?",
    answer: "Pro (₹449/month) includes full-stack coding, OS commands, project generation, and document creation. Elite (₹999/month) adds ADB Android control, database management, Excel automation, and priority support. Elite also includes all future premium features."
  },
  
  // Troubleshooting
  {
    category: "Troubleshooting",
    question: "The PC Bridge won't connect. What should I do?",
    answer: "First, ensure Python 3.8+ is installed and added to PATH. Install required packages with 'pip install flask flask-cors pyautogui pillow python-pptx openpyxl'. Run the bridge script and check if it shows 'Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001'. Make sure your firewall allows the connection."
  },
  {
    category: "Troubleshooting",
    question: "Voice commands are not working. How do I fix this?",
    answer: "Ensure you have a Pro or Elite subscription. Check that your browser has microphone permissions enabled. Press Alt+V to activate voice mode. If issues persist, try using Chrome browser as it has the best speech recognition support."
  },
  {
    category: "Troubleshooting",
    question: "My screenshots aren't being saved. What's wrong?",
    answer: "Check that the PC Bridge is running and connected (green indicator). Ensure the save path exists and is writable. You can configure custom screenshot paths in Settings > Output Paths. Default path is your Pictures/Screenshots folder."
  },
  {
    category: "Troubleshooting",
    question: "ALSA AI is not responding to my messages.",
    answer: "If the AI is not responding, it could be due to high server load. Wait a few seconds and try again. If issues persist, contact our support team at support@alsa-ai.in. You can also add a backup API key in Settings for uninterrupted service."
  },
  
  // Privacy & Security
  {
    category: "Security",
    question: "Is my data safe with ALSA AI?",
    answer: "We take privacy seriously. Your conversations are encrypted and stored securely. The PC Bridge runs locally - we never have access to your files. We don't sell or share your personal data with third parties. See our Privacy Policy for full details."
  },
  {
    category: "Security",
    question: "Can ALSA AI access my personal files?",
    answer: "ALSA AI can only access files you explicitly ask it to work with. The PC Bridge executes commands locally on your machine under your user permissions. It cannot access files without your direct instruction."
  },
  {
    category: "Security",
    question: "How do I secure my ALSA AI account?",
    answer: "Use a strong, unique password. Enable two-factor authentication if available. Don't share your login credentials or bridge tokens. Log out from shared computers. Report any suspicious activity to support@alsa-ai.in immediately."
